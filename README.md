## Airbus Ship Detection Challenge
This task is about finding ships on satellite images as quickly as possible. we determine to use ResNet50 to classify images into two categories. In the second part, we plan to use segmentation masks and segmentation models U-Net and Mask-RCNN to identify ships, and use F2 score to evaluate these models. 

We divide the task into four parts: classification, data process, segmentation model training, and model evaluation.
